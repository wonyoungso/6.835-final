How possibly an urban data visualization story and the exploratory data analysis can be manipulated and effectively delivered using gestural interfaces? How do we combine linear-based data storytelling with explorary data analysis?

In urban data visualization, a web-based map have been used with other graphical layers such as boundaries with colors, buildings, roads, and visual elements. In general, manipulating an urban data visualization story requires complicated interactions where a user has to explore different scales in the map, compare different cities, play and pause temporal data, and so on. However, because of the limitation that the modern computer interfaces--keyboard and mouse have dominated--had, the way people present their urban data visualization story has been limited, and even simplified into one dimension; utilizing scrolling interaction has been one of the most popular method of web-based data visualization, thus eliminating a chance for users to dig into the data and obtain insights. 

This project proposes a way interact with an urban data visualization when a presenter delivers their data story using gestural interfaces, and especially proposes a way of combining a linear storytelling with exploratory data analysis--especially in urban data visualization context, it could be about setting different scales and examining spatiotemporal data. Like the legendary statistician and physiclan Hans Rosling, an urban data research could elegantly present their work using gestural interfaces.
